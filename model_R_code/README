Follow the given steps to generate the model and get the results on train and test data.

1. Install R.
Use the link http://www.r-project.org/ to install R on Windows/Mac/Linux.

2. Run the install_packages.R script with root access. This file will install the required packages. Use the following command to run the script.
> Rscript install_packages.R

3. Change the values of user, host, password, dbname in line 33 in model.R file as per your configuration (This line connects to your MySQL server). Also ensure that 'mailing_data' table is the final table that contains all the data, or change the table accordingly in line 34.

4. Run the model.R script and store its output in a file.
> Rscript model.R > model_information.txt

Here 'model_information.txt' file will have information about the stats of model. Also 2 files (train_data_results.csv and test_data_results.csv) will be generated that will contain results of applying linear regression model on the train and test data.

anfis.R

I have added 'anfis.R' script that uses 'Adaptive Neuro Fuzzy Inference System' to build the prediction model. Run this script using the same steps and get the results on train and test data.
